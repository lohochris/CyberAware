    <h2>What Is Online Abuse?</h2>
    <p>
        Online abuse refers to harmful or threatening behaviour carried out through
        digital platforms such as social media, email, or messaging services.
        It may be repeated or occur as a single serious incident.
    </p>

    <p>
        Understanding online abuse helps individuals recognise harmful behaviour
        and make informed decisions about how to respond or seek support.

    <h2>How Online Abuse Can Affect Adults</h2>
    <p>
        Experiences of online abuse may affect emotional wellbeing, sleep,
        work performance, relationships, and confidence in participating online.
        The impact varies from person to person and should not be minimised.
    </p>

    <p>
        Recognising these effects is important in deciding when to seek support
        or take practical steps to protect one’s wellbeing.

    <h2>Why Awareness Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Understanding what constitutes online abuse helps individuals recognise
        harmful behaviour, take appropriate action, and seek support when needed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Early awareness can also reduce long-term emotional impact and encourage
        safer engagement with digital platforms.
