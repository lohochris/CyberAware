    <h2>Step 1: Preserve Evidence</h2>
    <p>
        Keep records of abusive messages or posts. This may include screenshots,
        message URLs, dates, times, and usernames. Avoid altering the evidence.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2: Use Platform Tools</h2>
    <p>
        Most social media and messaging platforms provide tools to block, mute,
        or report abusive behaviour. Reporting within the platform can help
        stop further contact.

    <h2>Step 3: Consider Reporting Externally</h2>
    <p>
        If the behaviour is threatening, persistent, or involves sharing personal
        images without consent, you may consider contacting the police or a
        relevant organisation for advice.

    <h2>Step 4: Seek Support</h2>
    <p>
        Online abuse can affect wellbeing. Speaking to a trusted person or
        contacting a support service may help you feel less isolated.
